# Wend Engine
A game engine for first-person dungeon crawlers.

## Ethos

Wend Engine is a low-level C/C++ game engine. My goals are for games made in Wend Engine to be performant and playable on as many computers as possible. Memory safety is critically important to Wend Engine, so I will taking careful consideration to ensure as such. This project will be 100% human-made, no AI. I personally believe in the power and meaning in art, in everything we as people can imagine and create.

## Inspiration

I strongly believe in the [Handmade Manifesto](https://handmade.network/manifesto), and my work is inspired by creators like Freya Holm√©r. Computers are fascinating devices and projects such as this one, and all the others in the Handmade network, aim to demystify how computers work while making applications that are lightning-fast. They say not to reinvent the wheel, but to learn how computers work, sometimes that's what you have to do.

## Intention

Wend Engine will begin life as a Windows only, software-rendered engine. Once the basis of this is complete and stable as a game engine, it will be upgraded to hardware-rendered, using OpenGL or Vulkan to begin with. After this, Linux will be implemented, along with necessary cross-platform abstractions. It is a solo project, and I will not be accepting contributions or collaborators to the repository. It is publicly viewable, but as I have not included a license, no-one other than myself is permitted to edit, fork or reproduce this project. Eventually, when I am happy with my work on the project, I will list Wend Engine under an FOSS license.

## Why "Wend"?

- To turn, change or adapt
- To pursue one's way

Wend Engine's purpose is to be the engine driving a game titled *Wend*. Wend is thematically relevant to the game and is personally meaningful to me.
